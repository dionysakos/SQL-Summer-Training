-- The function defined above returns one value only
-- We use LIMIT 1 in order to return one value only
-- Using OFFSET we skip the first N-1 values so we get the Nth higher value 
-- In MySQL, we cannot put expressions like N-1 directly in the OFFSET clause, we have to declare them first and calculate them before using it
